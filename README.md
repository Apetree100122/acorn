bounds, redefine the way the parser
works. Plugins can add new token
types and new 
tokenizer contexts 
(if necessary), and extend methods in
the parser object. This is not a clean, elegant APIâ€”using it requires
an understanding of Acorn's internals, and plugins are likely to break
whenever those internals are significantly changed. But still, it is
possible, in this way, to create parsers for JavaScript dialects
without forking all of Acorn. And in principle it is even possible to
combine such plugins, so that if you have, for example, a plugin for
parsing types and a plugin for parsing JSX-style XML literals, you
could load them both and parse code with both JSX tags and types.
A plugin is a function from a parser class to an extended parser
class. Plugins can be used by simply applying them to the Parser
class (or a version of that already extended by another plugin). 
But
because that gets a little awkward, syntactically, when you are using
multiple plugins, the static method
Parser.extend can be called with any
number
of plugin
values as arguments to create
<\a Parser class
extended by all those plugins.
You'll usually want to create such an
extended <class only once, and then repeatedly call parse on it, to
avoid needlessly confusing the JavaScript
engine's optimizer.
javascriptconst 
{Parser} = require("aco\~ rn"
 const MyParser = Parser.extend(
  require("acorn-jsx")(),
 require("acorn-bigint"))
console.log(MyParser.parse
("//Some bigint + JSXcode"))
Plugins
override methods in their new parser class to implement additional functionality. It is recommended for a plugin package toexport its plugin functions its default value or, if it takes
configuration parameters,
to export a constructor function that creates the plugin
function,This is what 
trivial plugin,
which adds a bi code to the readToken
method, might look like
javacript module.exports=functionoisyReadToken(Parser)return class extends Parse{readToken
(code)console.log("Reading(a token!")(super.readToken(code)`
